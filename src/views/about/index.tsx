// I considered myself liquid of just recently.
// Before, I can acknowledge that I held myself
// to present myself to be in a superior position
// because I had a head start of my peers.

// I recently met someone, where we don't have a
// connection at all. We aren't friends, we don't
// follow each other on Instagram, we haven't even
// talked after our first interaction. Hell, I don't
// even know what he looks like anymore. He doesn't
// even do anything computer related. However, what
// left a mark was his demeanor and way of approaching
// things from a liquid perspective was truly apparent.
// He took debates and concepts in an inferior yet
// confident position, such that he definitely had
// his own knowledge, but took ideas and concepts
// in such an inferior way where he exhibited his
// willingness to learn from anyone and their own
// perspective.

// I never asked him why, and how he thinks the way
// he does. Even without his explanation nor reasoning,
// I could understand that his approach of inferiority
// invited reflections of approaches from different perspectives.

// You'll find that people will tell you variable advice
// in order to stay confident. But your confidence
// shows arrogance, and your arrogance blocks possibilities
// of the truth.
