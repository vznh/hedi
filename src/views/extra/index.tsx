// I think (yes, I am not confident)
// music is my love language. For me,
// telling someone about my favorite song
// at the moment, or sharing a song I
// recently found to be one of my favorites
// is my first, maybe even paramount ways of
// expressing that I care for someone.

// Music is also indicative of the phases
// (or at least for me ...) that I go through
// in life. Not in the way as if there is genres of
// music that pertains to a certain archetype of
// person, but rather switching genres of music
// is just a way to show that I've shed my shell.

// Basically, though:
// So my *all-time favorites* aren't indicative of
// who I am. Maybe just see what I listen to recently,
// because chances are, I'll forget this song
// that I so love and dearly hold to my heart right now
// in the past.
