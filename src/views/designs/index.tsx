// Do you remember this?
// "What would your dream job be if money wasn't an issue?"
// I'd say design. I've used it everywhere I go.
// * Do I need to get the word out? Design.
// * Do I need to visually communicate my perspective? Design.
// * Do I need to visualize the flow of how my algorithm will work? Design.
// * "Do I need" is a common factor. This need is met by design.

// Being able to effectively communicate
// anything is a trait I greatly value. Being
// able to visually do so is just a step towards something great.
